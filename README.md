# Project : Identify fraud from Enron Email

In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial datas of top enron executives. 

The Enron datasets comprising emails and financial datas of Enron were made available for public for research and analysis and can be downloaded from : https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~./enron/.

### Goal of the project
The goal of this project is to use the machine learning skills to build a POI(person of interest) identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal. The POI is an acronym for 'person of interest' i.e., a person who is charged by the law for commiting a crime, in this case the scandal at Enron.  

The overall work done for this project can be divided into four parts :
   1.  __Exploring the Enron Dataset__  
       This involves data cleaning, outlier removal and analyzing.

   2.  __Feature processing of the Enron dataset__  
       It includes feature creation, feature scaling, feature selection and feature transform.
      
   3.  __Choosing the algorithm__   
       As the dataset given has labelled data and output expected is also discrete so supervised learning techniques are used in this project. The supervised learning algorithms are tuned to achieve the best performance on the test dataset. 
       
   4. __Evaluation__  
      This step involves validation followed by overall performance check of the project done using evaluation metrics such as precision, recall and f1_score.
